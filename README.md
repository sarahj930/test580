## Demo link: https://sarahj930.github.io/test580/
## How to play: 
Click on the link above - make sure you are using Google Chrome! Make sure you have your volume up as this is a listening game and all of the instructions will be read aloud. If you want, you can right click and select "inspect" to see the instructions printed out in the console. 

## Who is it for?
Visually impaired kids (primarily geared towards pre-K math skills but can be fun for all ages!) Ideally, this game would be played on a tablet of some kind so that the edges of the device can be used to locate predictable regions of the screen by visually impaired people. 

## What is it? How will it work? 
It is a math game using music! We have done some research about how music can be used to teach basic math skills like one-to-one correspondence, counting, making comparisons, and concepts such as more than, less than, equal, and same as. 
There are four beat tiles that make various musical notes. It will have 2 modes: Pattern Recognition and Making Comparisons. To play, pick a mode, then learn the sounds that each tile makes in that mode, hear a description of the game, do a practice run, and then play!
